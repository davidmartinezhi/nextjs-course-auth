How authentication works

Server side session and Authentication tokens (next auth has both)

Server side session
    - store unique identifier on server, send same identifier to client
    - client send identifier along with request to protect resources

Authentication tokens
    - create (but not store) permissions token on server, send token to client
    - client sends token along with requests rto protect resources

Si el server no ve cada request, usar tokens

Generated with 3 main building blocks

    Custom data
    Secret Signing key

    Server side token creation + signing = JSON web token
